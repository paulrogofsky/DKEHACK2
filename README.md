# DKEHACK2
This was a PennApps project that Josh Karnofsky and Paul Rogofsky worked on. DKEHACK2 is a web application built in Node.js
using the Express framework that is supposed to allow users to copy a url of a web page discussing music, and our application
would immediately create a Spotify playlist of all the songs, artists, and albums discussed on that web page. As music
enthusiasts, we thought this would be very cool, in addition to enhancing both our Node.js knowledge, API handling, and 
machine learning experience.

We were able to successfully make the application connect to the Spotify API. However, our algorithm for 
scraping pages for Music information with high accuracy was never put into development due to time constraints. W
e will come back to this project at a later date.
